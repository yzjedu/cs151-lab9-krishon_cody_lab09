Objective: I was supposed to learn how to work with files and manipulate strings to output file data in a specific format.
We began by defining the high level tasks needed for the program. Next, we created functions for those tasks. Then, we 
developed the code that would solve our tasks. Lastly, we tested our program using various test cases. The key concept I explored was file reading and
storing information in lists from files. We tried extreme test cases. We initially encountered an issue with the outputting of file data, but 
after a class session, we understood it better. I liked working with Cody
