I was supposed to learn how to use files to store and read data to then use in 
my program. first we tried to figure out how we would display the different
seating arrangements, then we worked from there trying to figure out
how to open, read, and close files to retain the data from. Our results do
match what we expected to get. The biggest challenge for us was figuring out 
the different return values and parameters to make the program work. We first designed
our program, then wrote the program, then tested it to make sure it works
with different inputs. I think I learned what I was supposed to because I now understand
what to do when it comes with files. Working with Krishon was nice.
